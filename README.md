<h1 align="center">    Hi! 👋🏼   I'm Harsham!  </h1>
<h4 align="center" >   I am a Junior Full-stack Web Developer 👨🏽‍💻 </h4>
<h3 align="center">  About me 🚀   </h3>
<p align="center" > 😁 I'm an aspiring developer trained in Full Stack Development at the School of Code. A passionate developer with a deep love for coding and problem-solving. Over the past few months, I've honed my skills and knowledge in coding, focusing mainly on Javascript, React and other frameworks, allowing me to tackle a wide range of projects and challenges.

🚀 My journey in the world of programming began with my initial fascination with the funcionality and creation of systems. As I grew through my adolescent years, my interest only grew further to a point where it began to take over my life. Systems I'd encounter in my everyday life led to me pondering on how they worked and were even created! Since then, I have been on an exciting quest to learn and grow as a developer, constantly exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends to increase my understanding of newer technologies.

🤔 To satisfy my desire and pursue my passion, I have looked into multiple other programming languages as opposed to JavaScript to get a test of what they have to offer in the hopes it broadens my horizons as I become acquainted with the tech space. I have acquired foundational knowledge in Python and C++. Although (for now) I have looked at the basics of either, I'd like to potentially explore these languages or others to better my arsenal as I begin my entry into the tech industry.

- A little interesting fact: As you can probably see to your left, that image is of the Santa Monica beach in California, aka my dream destination🤩
